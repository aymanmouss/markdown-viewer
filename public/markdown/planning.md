## Notes for Effective Study:

1. Stay hydrated and take short breaks as needed
2. Jot down any questions or concepts you want to explore further
3. Try to make connections between Java concepts and their potential use in Angular or Spring Boot

## Progress Tracking:

- Java: Completed Tic-tac-toe project, starting Les classes mathématiques
- Angular: Beginning with basics, setting up first project
- Spring Boot: Not covered today, plan to introduce soon

Remember, it's okay to adjust this schedule based on your energy levels and learning pace. If you find yourself needing more time on a particular topic, feel free to extend that session and adjust the others accordingly.
